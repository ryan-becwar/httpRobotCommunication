USAGE
Starting the Server:
$ ./server -h <hostname-of-robot> -i <robot-id> -n <robot-number> -p <port>

        -h <hostname-of-robot>: Address/Hostname of the robot to communicate with

        -i <robot-id>: ID of robot

        -n <robot-number>: Number of robot; used to get pictures

        -p <port>: Port that the server will listen on for connections

Starting the Client:
$ ./client -h <hostname-of-server> -p <port> -n <number> -l <length-of-sides>

        -h <hostname-of-server>: Address/Hostname of the proxy server

        -p <port>: Port that the proxy server is listening on

        -n <number-of-sides>: A number between 4 and 8 (inclusively) defining the number of sides

        -l <length-of-sides>: A number that defines the length of the sides

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project utilizes a custom network protocol developed by the entirety of the CPSC 3600 class. This protocol augments UDP with additional functionality, allowing for segmenting large files to fit within a small packet size. The protocol's packet size is capped at 300 bytes, and the class-defined header is 28 bytes, leaving only 272 bytes for every payload. This makes segmenting extraordinarily important. The header contains a total file size, along with byte offsets and payload size, to allow for comprehensive segmentation and reconstruction for both clients and servers. 

The project contains a client and server program which work together to interface with a server that contains data simulating virtual robots. The server program, which serves as a proxy between the client and the robot server, forwards commands sent from the client, by translating them into HTTP requests. 

DESIGN
We divided our souce files into two separate directories in order to maintain the distinction
between the client and server's functionality.  

KNOWN ISSUES
We are not certain that our image transfer is succesful, as we have been unable to properly test
this functionality as the robot server is down, and the practice server provided does not transfer
images in the same format as originally specified.
